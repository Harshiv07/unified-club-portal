## Unified Club Portal - Solution for all your club and event management needs

#### The idea behind this problem statement is to create a one-stop platform for clubs to reach out to the students/audience and share information about their club and their upcoming events. The platform serves the following features:

## Users:
* Admin
  * Can create and manage clubs.
  * View club
  * View feedbacks
* Clubs
  * Can organize events.
  * View their event status and members
  * Send invitation and announcement emails/notifications to their members and registered participants for their events. 
* Participants
  * Can register as a member of any club.
  * Can view clubs and their events.
  * Can rate the events.
* Event
  * Must have an event title, description, time, and register feature.
  * Can also contain posters.
  * Real-time registration and check-in stats.
* Club
  * Announcement page - announcements for their upcoming events.
  * Email notifier - email their members and/or event participants.

### Usage:
* Visit the deployed URL and sign up as a participant to join/leave events, rate feedback, view and register in clubs, and receive email notifications.
* You must sign in as an admin to manage clubs, organize events, and view feedback. These are the test credentials for admin (email: pharshiv10@gmail.com, password: Light10)
